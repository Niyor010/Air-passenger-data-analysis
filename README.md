# ✈️ Air Passengers Time Series Analysis (1949–1960)

This repository presents a comprehensive time series analysis of international airline passenger data from 1949 to 1960. The project highlights key trends, seasonal variations, and statistical insights into how global air travel evolved over this period. The dataset, composed of monthly records, is an excellent case study for learning time series analysis, data visualization, and pattern recognition using Python.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains:
- Monthly passenger numbers from **January 1949 to December 1960**
- One record per month (total: 144 observations)
- Source: Classic airline passenger dataset used widely in time series forecasting tasks

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and prepare time series data
- Analyze long-term passenger growth trends
- Explore seasonal travel patterns
- Visualize time series using line and bar plots
- Compute summary statistics
- Lay the foundation for forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Airline passenger numbers show a **strong upward trend** from 1949 to 1960
- **July and August** consistently have the highest travel volumes, revealing a seasonal peak
- **January and February** are typically the lowest, confirming cyclical behavior
- The data is ideal for time series forecasting due to its clear trend and seasonality

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- 📅 Line plot of monthly passenger numbers (1949–1960)
- 📊 Bar chart of average passengers per calendar month
- 📃 Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles)
